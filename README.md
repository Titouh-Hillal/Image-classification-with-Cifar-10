# 📦 CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project
This project demonstrates a deep learning model for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 10 categories:
    airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck
The model achieves 87.45% accuracy on the test dataset.

# 🧠 Overview 
CIFAR-10 is a widely used benchmark dataset in computer vision research.
## 📚 Reference: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
The project uses TensorFlow Keras for training and Gradio for building a simple web interface to test the model.
